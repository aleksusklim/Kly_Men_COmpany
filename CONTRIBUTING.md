# [Kly_Men_COmpany][]/[CONTRIBUTING][]:

## Rules

I don't accept any pull requests or code merging with something else.

Also, here will be no issues/comments/tags nor meaningful commit messages. If you need to contact me - do it only via email: `aleksusklim@gmail.com`.

Still, you can clone any particular project, or download its source from GutHub.

Often a project description would have external links to releases with compiled binaries!

All my work is always licensed under WTFPL - public domain, no attribution required.

### Note

From time to time I will recreate my projects, destroying old commit history. But all releases will stay archived on external sites. Don't worry, current live code version will be still there in repos.
