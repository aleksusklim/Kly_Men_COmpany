## Rules

I don't accept any pull requests or code merging with something else.

Also, here will be no issues/comments/tags nor meaningful commit messages. If you need to contact me - do it only via email: `aleksusklim@gmail.com`.

Still, you can clone any particular project, or download its source from GutHub.

Often a project description would have external links to releases with compiled binaries!

All my work is always licensed under WTFPL - public domain, no attribution required.

### Note

From time to time, I will recreate my projects, destroying old commit history. But all releases will stay archived on external sites. Don't worry, current live code version will be still there in repos.

Thus, do not link directly to any file inside a repository, nor to any particular commit or tag. Instead, copy anything you need and track it yourself.
